## TO DO LIST ##
* Data Pre Propcessing 
    - A better approach is to sample according to the conditional probabilityof the values occurring, given the underlying class for that example. The choice of strategy is yours,but be sure to document your choice
    - Normalization of data to be on (-1, 1) [Claire, Due 10/23]
* Base Python File Set-Up []
* Pseduocode for Hidden Nodes Tuning Process [All, Discuss 10/23]
    - You will need to determine the number of hidden nodes per layer via a tuning process
* Pseudocode for MLP (multi layer feedforward network with backpropogation) [All, Discuss 10/23] 
    -  arbitrary number of inputs, an arbitrary number of hidden layers, an arbitrary numberof hidden nodes by layer, and an arbitrary number of outputs
* Define Regression and Clasification Functions 
    -  (OLIVIA) Be able to specify whether a node uses a linear activation function for regression or a sigmoidal activationfunction for classification (you may choose between logistic or hyperbolic tangent) 
* Develop hypothesis focusing on convergence rate and final performance [All, Discuss 10/23]
* Implement MLP Algorithm 
* Paper 
* Video
