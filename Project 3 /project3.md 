## TO DO LIST ##
* Data Pre Propcessing 
    - A better approach is to sample according to the conditional probabilityof the values occurring, given the underlying class for that example. The choice of strategy is yours,but be sure to document your choice
    - Normalization of data to be on (-1, 1)
    - You will need to determine the number of hidden nodes per layer via a tuning process
* multi layer feedforward network with backpropogation 
    -  arbitrary number of inputs, an arbitrary number of hidden layers, an arbitrary numberof hidden nodes by layer, and an arbitrary number of outputs
    -  (OLIVIA) Be able to specify whether a node uses a linear activation function for regression or a sigmoidal activationfunction for classification (you may choose between logistic or hyperbolic tangent) 
* A hypothesis focusing on convergence rate and final performance
* Test MLP Algorithm 
* Paper 
* Video
