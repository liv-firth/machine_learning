### Project 4 

Pseudocode by Wednesday 

1. Genetic Algorithm 
2. Differential Evolution (Hannah)

        1. initialize a random set of individuals throughout the search space

        2. while iter <= # of max generations

          3. cycle through each individual in the population
  
              perform mutation
    
              perform crossover
    
              perform selection
    
          if stopping criteria has been met:
  
          return the best individual
    
          else:
  
          return to step 3
