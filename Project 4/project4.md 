### Project 4 

Pseudocode by Wednesday 

1. Genetic Algorithm (Claire)
2. Differential Evolution (Hannah)
3. Particle Swarm Optimization (Olivia)
    Train to 0, 1, and 2 Hidden Layers 
    Will need to demonstrate:
        * pbest calculation
        * gbest calculation 
        * velocity update 
        * position update.
